ULPGC project for 2022/2023 in subject DACD 

<h1>Disclaimer</h1> 
I want to let the reader know, that the code implementation is not the fanciest one. In the sense that the SQLite database has been filled by columns and not by rows. So sorry if someone gets sentimentally hurted. In future versions or commits I will change the whole code to make it look better :thumbsup:

<h2>REMEMBER</h2>
Remember introduce the CLIENT_ID and the SECRET_CLIENT_ID in the SpotifyAccesor to use the program
